# CLI Habit Tracker

A simple command-line-interface habit tracker, created to be run right in your terminal.  

## Description

Add your own habits, track them and see your streak grow(or break) or choose to use the pre-populated demo data to get a feel for the habit tracker. 
Skip down to the analyse menu to view your habits, see your longest streak or see when your streaks were reset.
